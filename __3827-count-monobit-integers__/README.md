# 3827. Count Monobit Integers

You are given an integer n.

An integer is called Monobit if all bits in its binary representation are the same.

Return the count of Monobit integers in the range [0, n] (inclusive).

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: n = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:


	The integers in the range [0, 1] have binary representations &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;.
	Each representation consists of identical bits. Thus, the answer is 2.



Example 2:


Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:


	The integers in the range [0, 4] include binaries &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, and &quot;100&quot;.
	Only 0, 1 and 3 satisfy the Monobit condition. Thus, the answer is 3.

Constraints:


	0 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000
